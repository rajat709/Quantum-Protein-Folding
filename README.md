# Quantum-Protein-Folding
### Abstract
Protein folding has been one of the most difficult problems for over a half-century,The
random thermal motions causing conformational changes that lead energetically
downhill towards the native structure, a principle captured in funnel-shaped energy
landscapes.Unfolded polypeptides have a wide range of possible conformations. The
search problem becomes intractable for classical computers due to the exponential
growth of potential conformations with chain length. So far, there is theoretical and
experimental evidence that solving such optimization problems using Quantum
Computing approaches such as Quantum Annealing, VQE, and QAOA has an
advantage. Although Google's DeepMind-AlphaFold has accomplished much,But we
can go even further with the quantum approach.Here we show how to predict structure
of protein as well as RNA folding using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) expectation values for the solution of the problem and
for finding the minimum configuration energy and our task is to identify a protein's
minimal energy structure. The protein's structure is optimized to reduce energy. Also
making sure that all physical constraints are met and encoding the protein folding
problem into a qubit operator.
